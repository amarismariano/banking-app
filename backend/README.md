# Payment Management Backend

This is the backend for the **Payment Management System**. The backend serves as a REST API that handles user authentication and payment management operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting payments. The API ensures secure access via JWT-based authentication.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in with secure JWT-based authentication.
- **Payment Management**: API endpoints for managing payments (create, read, update, delete).
- **Authorization**: Ensures that only authenticated users can manage their own payments.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error responses for invalid operations or inputs.
- **MongoDB Integration**: All data is stored and managed using MongoDB as the database.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for backend logic.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the REST API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and payment data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Dotenv**: For environment variable management.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (Running locally or remotely)
